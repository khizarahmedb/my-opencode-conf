# Repo Agent Instructions

1. At the start of every conversation in this repository, read `AGENT_NOTES.md` before proposing or writing changes.
2. If `skills.md` exists, review it and use relevant skills/workflows for the task.
3. Prefer retrieval-led reasoning over pre-training-led reasoning for framework/version-sensitive tasks.
4. Explore project structure before retrieving external docs; then fetch only the minimum docs needed.
5. Keep instructions compact; point to retrievable files rather than embedding full documentation in AGENTS.
6. When a new stable preference appears, append it to `AGENT_NOTES.md` with a date and short rationale.
7. Keep notes concise and behavioral; do not store secrets, passwords, API tokens, or personal data.
8. If a note conflicts with an explicit user request in the current conversation, follow the explicit request and then update notes accordingly.
9. When repo-level notes are insufficient, consult `/Users/khizar/Documents/GitHub/AGENT_NOTES_GLOBAL.md`.
10. Do not copy global notes into local notes unless explicitly requested; reference them instead.
